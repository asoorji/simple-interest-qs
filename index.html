"question": "What is the simple interest on $500 at a rate of 8% per annum for 4 years?",
"options": ["$160", "$1600", "$640", "$1280"],
"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "The simple interest is given by the formula: I = Prt, where P is the principal, r is the rate of interest per annum, and t is the time period in years. Substituting the given values, we get I = 5000.084 = $160."

"question": "What is the compound interest on $1000 at a rate of 10% per annum, compounded annually, for 2 years?",
"options": ["$210", "$2100", "$2200", "$2300"],
"answerIndex": 2,
"explanation": "The compound interest is given by the formula: A = P*(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after t years, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest per annum, n is the number of times interest is compounded in a year, and t is the time period in years. Substituting the given values, we get A = 1000(1 + 0.1/1)^(1*2) = $1210. The compound interest is therefore $1210 - $1000 = $220."

"question": "What is the rate of interest per annum if the simple interest on $800 for 2 years is $96?",
"options": ["6%", "8%", "10%", "12%"],
"answerIndex": 1,
"explanation": "The rate of interest is given by the formula: r = (I/P)100t, where I is the simple interest, P is the principal, and t is the time period in years. Substituting the given values, we get r = (96/800)1002 = 12%. Therefore, the correct option is 8%."
